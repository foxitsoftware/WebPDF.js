## Getting Started

### Online demo

+ http://184.105.214.152:8081/web/viewer.html

###Run up the package
   Unzip the package and then copy "webapp" and "build" folders to a web container;
   In a web browser, open http://{ip}:{port}/webapp/viewer.html to try out the viewer.
   
###Font server selection for non-embedded font files
webpdf.js need to connect a server to download the font file if a PDF contains no-embedded fonts. We provide 2 public font servers, one each in US and China.

There are two pdf.workder.js files, WebPDF.workder.cn.js is for Chinese server, WebPDF.workder.us.js is for US server.

WebPDF.worker.us.js is used by default. You can easily change it to the Chinese font server with the following.
Find webapp/webpdf.config.js，

>    var WebPDF = {
    'workerSrc' : '../build/WebPDF.worker.us.js'
   };

 Replace WebPDF.worker.us.js to WebPDF.worker.cn.js, and then open "viewer.html" again.
